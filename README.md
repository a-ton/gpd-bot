#### The Google Play Deals Bot does a few things for the /r/GooglePlayDeals subreddit:

* Responds to all app submissions on /r/GooglePlayDeals with information about the app found on the store page 
* Flairs deals when they are expired when users reply with "expired"
* Flairs deals with a new or popular tag based on the number of dowloads (New is <1,000 and popular is >10,000, and a 4 star rating)
* Can also respond to self text posts that contain links to more than 1 app.

#### These are the current features but here are a few more I would like to implement:

* Logging (errors) - Sort of implemented

### General workflow:

* reddit_response.py
  1. Monitors subreddit for new posts
  2. Scrapes the google play link for information using bs4 and Selenium
  3. Reply to post and add flair
  
* msg_monitor.py
  1. Monitors inbox for unread comment replies
  2. Replies to comment, checks if it has expired, and flairs post
  3. Marks comment as read and moves on

### Needed modules

* PRAW 5.2.0+
* bs4
* selenium
* Firefox browser and selenium drivfer

#### Other stuff

In order to run the bot, you need to fill out the Config.py file but currently we don't need another version of the bot running around so that probably won't matter. I'm uploading this to github for better version control and also because a few users have wanted to view the source of the bot. Any help would be appreciated if you want to contribute to the project. 

**Feel free to submit issues for ideas you have or issues with the bot!**
